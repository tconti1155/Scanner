# Scanner
Scanner App

The Scanner application allows the user to scan a barcode and input the name or description of the item and its location. 
It uses the xzing API  to scan and pull the information off the item.  This can be found on GitHub. It allows for scanning,
sorting, searching, renaming and also downloading of the information it self. The app holds all the information in MySQL database.
The image buttons and backgrounds are all created in Photoshop. The rest of the application is in Java, XML and created using
Android Studio.

I would like to improve the application to allow the user to create there own barcodes and also be able to store 2 barcodes
for each item. This could be used to help keep better organization of there items. I would also like to add ability for them
upload a database they have created.  Thus, be able to edit and work the data on the application it self.
